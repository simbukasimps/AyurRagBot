As stated in the Charaka Samhita, a classical Ayurvedic text, meditation helps to balance the doshas and promote overall well-being. To incorporate meditation into your daily routine, start with short sessions, focusing on your breath, and gradually increase duration. Remember, a calm mind and body are essential for spiritual exploration and self-discovery."
What is advised about mealtime in Ayurveda?,"One should eat the main meal at noon when digestive fire is strongest, and avoid eating after sunset.","In Ayurveda, it's advised to eat three meals a day, with lunch being the largest meal and dinner being the lightest. Eat breakfast, followed by a substantial lunch, and then a light dinner at least 3 hours before bedtime. Avoid snacks between meals and after dinner to allow for proper digestion. As the ancient Ayurvedic text, Charaka Samhita, suggests, ""Eat according to your digestive fire"" - this means eating when your body is most capable of digesting food, which is typically during the daytime."
